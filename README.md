# Stock-Analysis - Challenge 2

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018 in order to determine the best investment option. In terms of the code, the goal of the project is to ensure that the script is more efficient than the one original by improving the logic of the code, making it easier to read and reducing the execution time. 

## Results

## Summary
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
#### Advantages
- Makes the code easier to understand, as the script becomes cleaner and more organized.
- Helps finding bus
- Helps to improve the execution time
- Make the code more flexible to adapt to changes or updates of the software
#### Disadvantages:
- Time consuming when the code is large and complex
- Easy to misinterpret if the original script is not well explained and the developer is unable to fully understand the procedure. 
- The cost and time of refactoring can be higher than creating a new code.
- Refactoring requires a very solid test procedure as well a time to complete the tests.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The biggest pro of refactoring the code was that the execution time was reduced from x to x for 2017 and from x to x for 2018. On the other side, the biggest con was to try to understand the logic of the original script. In some instances, I believe that the time of refactoring could have been higher than creating a new code from Scratch.
